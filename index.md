  ## Reporting Issues
  This GitHub site is for reporting issues (bugs, feature requests) for the asmeconf LaTeX template.
  
  For general questions about LaTeX (or Tex Live, Overleaf, etc.), [tex-stackexchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) is an excellent source of advice.
  
  ## Downloading the code
   The asmeconf files may be downloaded from CTAN: [ctan.org/pkg/asmeconf](https://ctan.org/pkg/asmeconf). 
   
   This class is also included in standard distributions such as TeX Live, MikTeX, and Overleaf. 
  
  ## Overview
  This LaTeX class and BibTeX style provide a template to format ASME Conference papers according to
  the current requirements on ASME's web pages: [www.asme.org/publications-submissions/proceedings/formatting-the-paper](https://www.asme.org/publications-submissions/proceedings/formatting-the-paper)
  
  The asmeconf class provides access to many features not available in older LaTeX templates for ASME papers. The class is designed toward the following aims:

- match ASME's font current specifications and layout

- match ASME's current reference formats, with support for DOI and URL fields

- support hyperlinks to figures, tables, equations, references, and external URLs

- support pdf bookmarks and metadata

- set author names and addresses in either the traditional grid or the more recent inline style

- support PDF/A (archival) standards if desired

- provide line numbers for editing and review

- support balancing of columns on last page

- support copyright footer for federal employees and contractors

- enable math and text features from the newtxmath, mathalfa, newtxtext, and inconsolata packages

- support bold face, sans serif math in section headings

- support footnotes and citations in section headings

- enable passages in other languages, e.g., for a translation of the abstract or a quotation

- support for many scripts: Latin, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hangul, Japanese, Tamil

The .tex and .cls files are commented and should be self-explanatory.
