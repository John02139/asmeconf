  ## Downloading the code ##
   This GitHub site is for reporting issues. The files may be downloaded from CTAN: [ctan.org/pkg/asmeconf](https://ctan.org/pkg/asmeconf). This class is also included in standard distributions such as TeX Live, MikTeX, and Overleaf. 
  
  ## Overview ##
  This LaTeX class and BibTeX style provide a template to format ASME Conference papers according to
  the current requirements on ASME's web pages: [www.asme.org/publications-submissions/proceedings/formatting-the-paper](https://www.asme.org/publications-submissions/proceedings/formatting-the-paper)
  
  The asmeconf class provides access to many features not available in older LaTeX templates for ASME papers. The class is designed toward the following aims:

- match ASME's font current specifications and layout

- match ASME's current reference formats, and add support for DOI and URL fields

- support hyperlinks to figures, tables, equations, references, and external URLs

- support pdf bookmarks and metadata

- set author names and addresses in either the traditional grid or the more recent inline style

- support PDF/A (archival) standards if desired

- enable various math and text features from the newtxmath and newtxtext packages

- provide line numbers for editing and review

- support balancing of columns on last page

- support copyright footer for federal employees and contractors

- support bold face, sans serif math in section headings

- support footnotes in section headings

The .tex and .cls files are commented and should be self-explanatory.
