  ## Overview ##
  This LaTeX class and BibTeX style provide a template to format ASME Conference papers according to
  the requirements on ASME's web pages (as posted in 2020).
  
  [www.asme.org/publications-submissions/proceedings/formatting-the-paper](https://www.asme.org/publications-submissions/proceedings/formatting-the-paper)
  
  The asmeconf class provides access to many features not available in older LaTeX templates for ASME papers. It is designed to approach the following aims:

- match ASME's font current specifications and layout

- match ASME's current reference formats, and add support for DOI and URL fields

- support hyperlinks to figures, tables, equations, references, and external URLs

- support pdf bookmarks and metadata

- set author names and addresses in either the traditional grid or the more recent inline style

- enable various math and text features with newtxmath and newtxtext packages

- support bold face, sans serif math in section headings

- support footnotes in section headings

- provide line numbers for editing and review

- support balancing of columns on last page

- support PDF/A (archival) standards if desired

- support copyright footer for federal employees and contractors

  The .tex and .cls files are commented and should be self-explanatory.

  The files in this distribution are:

          README.md              --  this file
          asmeconf.cls           --  the class file
          asmeconf.bst           --  bibtex style for ASME conference format
          asmeconf-template.tex  --  a latex template/example for this class
          asmeconf-template.pdf  --  documentation/sample paper
          asmeconf-sample.bib    --  a sample bibliography file
          *
          sample-figure-1.pdf, 
          sample-figure-2a.pdf, 
          sample-figure-2b.pdf   -- figures for the example
          *
          author-grid-style.pdf  -- example of title page with "authorgrid" option

  This work is not a publication of ASME itself.
